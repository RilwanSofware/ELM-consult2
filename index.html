                    There are many reasons why study abroad programs are becoming so popular. For most international students, the appeal is likely 
                    to be a combination of gaining a high-quality education, experiencing 
                    immersion in a new culture (and often a second language), gaining a global mindset 
                    and expanding future employment prospects.

                    You should also think about what sort of lifestyle you wish to have during your studies. Do you want to live in a big 
                    city or a small university town? Do you want arts and culture on your doorstep or world-class sporting facilities? Whatever 
                    your interests, be sure to match them up with your study destination so that you really give yourself the best chance of loving 
                    your international experience.
                    If you need help making up your mind, take a look at some of the most popular destinations – Australia, Canada, Germany, 
                    the UK and the US  – or use the links below to view our university rankings and full range of country guides.

                    Once you’ve made up your mind about where you want to study, you should start 
                    to think about choosing a program and a university, if you haven’t already. You can research 
                    leading universities with the QS World University Rankings®, use the subject rankings to discover 
                    universities which are best for your subject, and also consult national rankings of universities in 
                    your chosen destination.
                    You’ll then want to look closely at the courses offered by the institutions on your shortlist, as well as 
                    researching the local area and lifestyle, admission requirements and costs.

                    the sooner you can arrange your travels. To avoid disappointment, note down all the relevant application deadlines (set out by your
                     chosen university) in HUGE LETTERS on your calendar.
                      Application deadlines will be different depending on the school, but, for programs starting in the fall (September/October), 
                      applications will generally be open from early in the year (January/February) until the middle of the year (June/July).

                    and look for funding… don’t panic, it’ll all be worth it!

                    In fact, as soon as you gain acceptance from a university, the first thing you should start to consider is your travel 
                    documentation. Ensure you have a valid passport and travel insurance, as well as a student visa if you need one. 
                    Make sure you have sufficient time to get your passport/visa approved so that you’ll be able to travel legally.

                  my life to get student visa of USA, the complete credit goes to ELM Consults. Their continuous motivation has been proved as a 
                  toll of my success.

                  The entire Team of ELM Consults is very helpful and friendly. They guided me very well for the course selection. 
                  I was particularly confused regarding selection of course and university, so I was assisted in the best possible manner.
                   Interview preparation by Vijay Sir was very helpful. I became more confident and was able to cope up well. Overall my 
                   experience of dealing with ELM Consults was good. Thank You ELM Consults Team for everything.

              The entire Team of ELM Consults has supported me very nicely throughout my process. My Admission Application
               and Visa Application process went very smoothly because of efforts of the ELM Consults Team. ELM Consults has guided me 
               thoroughly and preciously for documentation throughout my process. I am proud of my decision to appoint ELM Consults as 
               my Consultant for my Student Visa Process of Canada. I will definitely recommend ELM Consults to my friends and close 
               ones who wish to Study Abroad.

                  I am completely satisfied by ELM Consults from my experience of dealing with them for my student visa application of Canada. 
                  Their efficiency about visa application process is commendable. I was surprised when I got my visa approval
                  just in 2 days, which was absolutely beyond imagination. Thanks ELM Consults for putting me in next step of ladder of my career.
